        <p>So my Name is pravin & i just started this journey towards web development.
            My examination for first year has just end up. Now I am here, After the end of examination I thought 
            to created lots of projects, works and internship too but in reality what we think that never gona happen ..
            But I want to make it happen. Right Now I am learning Web development & Networking.<br>
            I am planning to create a blog for this website. And if you want to know more about me ,<br> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pravin-sakhare-260720251/">My linkedin Profile</a>

            I also Start learning some out door things to boost my productivity. When i was living in pune i already start book reading
            but after the examination pandamic comes and i stop.<br>
            I decide to start my journey once again with full of enjoyment not with motivation. 
            <br>
            I just want to give you one small productivity tip that if you are targeting something to get in your life 
            then don't just motivated about that particular thing that you want rather than try to create a way that it will become 
            your daily habit. Simple example like brushing we never forget about brushing or never procrastinate that. <br>
            <h3> Why?</h3>
            Because it is our habit .. Try to make it simple and easy that next time you enjoy it and you don't need to watch motivated video to do that thing.
            <br>
